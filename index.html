    <p>Buying medicines online is common practice across the globe these days. This is because buyers are preferring to order for medicines through a click of a button rather than taking a trip to a drug store. Such online websites sell everything from prescription drugs to health related products. Most of such stores are legal outlets that safeguard all traditional procedures related to drug prescription. That is why most buyers are confident about dealing with these stores. But these are quite a few rogue stores that have come up in the recent past over the internet. These stores deal in illegal medications and unapproved drugs. Buyers must be aware of such rogue stores</p>
